**A Minecraft Fabric Mod adding a touch of eternal twilight to the Overworld.**

## 👋 About the Project
**Vesper Wilds** is a passion project created by **WarpGames** as part of a journey into Minecraft modding and Java development.

While fully functional, this is a **"Hobby Mod"** created to explore the Fabric API, Data Generation, and biome manipulation. Features are developed as I learn new coding concepts. Feedback is welcome, but please be patient with updates!

## 📖 The Lore
The Overworld is changing. Travelers have begun to report strange pockets of land where the sun never seems to fully rise—a place where the air hums with a quiet, purple static.

**They call it the Vesper Wilds.**

Scholars believe these biomes are not natural to our world, but are "leaks" from a dimension of eternal twilight. In these zones, the flora has adapted to the darkness, evolving into the soft, luxurious **Velvet Forests**. Deep beneath the soil, the earth has reacted to this alien energy, crystallizing into a new, volatile resource known as **Vesperite**.
